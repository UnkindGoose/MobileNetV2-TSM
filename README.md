# MobileNetV2-TSM
Implementation of Temporal Shift Module (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08383) using tensorflow.<br>
Notebook contains basic implementation of TSM layers with MobileNetV2 model. Dataset used for model training is https://github.com/ai-forever/bukva<br>
TODO:
* fix memory consumption since there is a lot of data copying
* train final model( ran out of money for cloud computing:( )
